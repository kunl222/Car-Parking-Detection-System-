# Car Parking Detection System Using YOLO and Streamlit
This project is a car parking detection system utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The system processes images uploaded by users and identifies parking spaces as either occupied or vacant.

## Key Features:
### YOLO for Detection: 
The model is trained on a dataset of parking images to detect parking spots and determine whether they are filled or empty.
### Contouring via Roboflow: 
The detected parking spaces are outlined using contouring, with red for occupied spaces and green for vacant ones. This preprocessing was done using Roboflow for efficient annotation and dataset management.
### Streamlit Deployment: 
The system is deployed as a web-based application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time parking space analysis.
### Automated Parking Space Identification:
The model eliminates the need for manual coordinate marking by automatically identifying parking spot locations.
This system provides an easy-to-use interface and an efficient solution for smart parking management. ðŸš—ðŸ’¡
